ReverseString

Given a string, reverse it using stack.

Test Cases: 
Input: geeksofjava
Output: avajfoskeeg

Input: hello
Output: olleh

Input: string reverse
Output: esrever gnirts

HINT: Use stack because of its LIFO (Last In First Out) property.

Algorithm:
Step-1: Push all the characters one by one to the stack
Step-2: Pop one by one all the characters back from the stack till the stack doesn't get empty and keep appending it to the new String.
Step-3: The new string is the reversed string.

Example:
Input: Hello

-	Read one by one all the characters from the string and push it to the stack.
	So stack will read as H e l l o
-	Pop one by one all the values from the stack so the order in which they will be popped is: o l l e H

Complexity:
Time complexity: O(n)
