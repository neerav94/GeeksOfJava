NextGreaterElement

Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.

Test Cases: 
Input: [3, 6, 8, 5, 12, 4, 9]
Output: 3-->6
	    6-->8
	    5-->12
	    8-->12
	    4-->9
	    9-->-1
	    12-->-1

Input: [4, 5, 2, 25]
Output: 4-->5
	    5-->25
	    2-->25
	    25-->-1

Algorithm:
Step-1: Push the first element in the stack
Step-2: Iterate for the rest of the elements of the array
Step-3: If the top of the stack is greater than the incoming element of the array or 
  the stack is empty than:
        i)  break the loop
        ii) push the array element onto the stack 
            else,
        i)  keep popping the element till the top of the stack is smaller than the 	  
       incoming element of the stack
Step-4: After the end of the loop, pop all the remaining elements of the stack and 	  print -1 for them

Example:
Input array=[4, 5, 2, 25]
-	Push 4 to the stack.
-	5 is greater than s.peek() so pop 4 and print it.
-	In the next iteration exit from the while loop and push 5 to the stack.
-	Push 2 the stack (s.peek()>2)
-	25 is greater than both the elements of the stack so pop both the elements and the next greater element will be 25 for both these elements.
-	Push 25 to the stack.
-	No more numbers to read, pop 25 and its next greater element is -1.
