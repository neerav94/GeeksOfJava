ClosestToZero:
Two elements whose sum is closest to zero
Question: An Array of integers is given, both +ve and -Â­ve. You need to find the two elements such that their
sum is closest to zero.

Algorithm:

1) Sort the array using Arrays.Sort(). This sorts the elements in ascending order.
2) Use two variables min_left and min_right to store the two numbers to get closest to zero
3) Start from both end of the array using variables l,r
4) find the sum of corresponding indexes and store in a temporary variable.
5) If the value of temp is < closest_sum then increment 'l' to point to higher value
6) If the value of temp is > closest_sum then decrement 'r' to point to lower value
7) Repeat the step 3-6 until l>r

Complexity:
Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
