Majority Element: A  majority  element  in  an  array A[]  of  size  n  is  an  element  that  appears  more  than  n/2
times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Algorithm:

Iterate over the entire elements of the array and while iterating,
1) Construct a HashMap that will store key as arr[i] and value=frequency of occurrence of arr[i]
2) If HashMap contains arr[i] as key, then increment the value of its frequency.
3) Check if the value > n/2. If true, return arr[i]. This is our majority element
4) If HashMap doesn't contains arr[i] as its key, add arr[i] into it with value=1
5) Return -1 if no majority elements are found.
