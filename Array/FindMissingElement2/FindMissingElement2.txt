FindMissingElement1:
Find the Missing Number
You are given a list of n-­1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in
list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer. 

Algorithm:
1) Find the sum of the elements of the array. Let this be stored in sum1
2) Since the numbers are in between 1 to n, this forms an arthimetic progression. Sum of numbers from 1 to n will be n(n+1)/2, let this be stored in sum2.
3) sum2-sum1 will give the missing element

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
