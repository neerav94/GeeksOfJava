Leader:
Leaders in an array
Write  a  program  to  print  all  the  LEADERS  in  the  array.  An  element  is  leader  if  it  is  greater  than  all  the
elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader.

Algorithm:
1) As mentionedrightmost element is always the leader, let it be our max 
2) Iterate over the element of the array from back.
3) For each i, compare a[i] and max.
4) If a[i]>max then a[i] is a leader and change the value of max=a[i]

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
