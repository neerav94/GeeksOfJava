FindMissingElement1:
Find the Missing Number
You are given a list of n-­1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in
list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer. 

Algorithm:

1) XOR all the elements of the array and let it be stored in xor1
2) XOR all the numbers from 1 to n and let it be stored in xor2
3) XOR xor1 and xor2, this will yield the missing number

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
