LargestContiguousArray:
Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
Write  an  efficient  C  program  to  find  the  sum  of  contiguous  subarray  within  a  one­dimensional  array  of
numbers which has the largest sum.


Algorithm:

NOTE: The algorithm used is known as Kadane's algorithm
1) Initialize two variables max_prev=0 and max_new=0
2) Iterate over the elements of the array and update max_prev=max_prev+a[i] where i is the index of the array
3) If max_prev<0, make max_prev=0
4) If max_prev>max_new then make max_new=max_prev
5) Repeat steps 3-4 until all elements are traversed.
6) The value of max_new is the desired output.

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
