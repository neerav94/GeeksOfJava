LargestMultipleOf3

Given an array of non-negative integers. Find the largest multiple of 3 that can be formed from array elements.

Test Cases: 
Input: [8, 1, 9]
Output: 981

Input: [8, 1, 7, 6, 0]
Output: 8760

Input: [2, 5, 9, 0, 6]
Output: 960

HINT: Use three queues.

Algorithm:
Step-1: Create 3 seperate queues.
Step-2: Sort the array. (Use Arrays.sort())
Step-3: if number%3==0 insert in q0
	if number%3==1 insert in q1
	if number%3==2 insert in q2
Step-4: sum up all the array elements
Step-5: if the sum of all the elements on dividing by 3 gives remainder as 1 than delete 1 element from q1 but if q1 is empty than delete 2 
	elements from q2 and if q2 has has less than 2 elements than the number is not possible
Step-6: if the sum of all the elements on dividing by 3 gives remainder as 2 than delete 1 element from q2 but if q2 is empty than delete 2 
	elements from q1 and if q1 has has less than 2 elements than the number is not possible
Step-7: Input all the elements from q0, q1 and q2 and insert them in an auxilliary array.
Step-8: Sort the auxilliary array in decreasing order

Example:

Input: [8, 1, 9]

•	Sort the array. Arr=[1,8,9]
•	1%3=1, so insert 1 in q1, 8%3=2, so insert 8 in q2, 9%3=0, so insert 9 in q0 .
•	Sum=18
•	Insert 1,8,9 in auxilliary array, aux=[1, 8, 9]
•	Sort the auxilliary array in descending order: [9, 8, 1]
•	Output: 981
