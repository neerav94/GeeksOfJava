GenerateBinaryNumber

Given a decimal number, n generate binary number of 1 to n.

Test Cases:
Input: 5
Output: 1 = 1
	    2 = 10
	    3 = 11
	    4 = 100
	    5 = 101

Input: 8
Output: 1 = 1
	    2 = 10
	    3 = 11
	    4 = 100
	    5 = 101
	    6 = 110
	    7 = 111
	    8 = 1000

Algorithm:
Step-1: Create a string queue and add 1 in the queue. That is the binary equivalent for 1.
Step-2: In the while loop which will run n times remove the front element and print it
Step-3: Append 0 and 1 to the recently removed element from the queue and add both these numbers back to the queue
Step-4: Goto step-2

Example:

Input: 3
�	Add 1 to the queue
�	Remove it from the queue and print it.
�	Store the removed element into 2 strings and append 0 and 1 to the new strings.
�	So the new string will be 10 and 11 and ad them to the queue.
�	Decreament n to n=2.
�	Remove 10 again and print it and repeat the above steps again.
�	Decreament n to n=1
�	Remove 11 from the queue and print it and repeat the above steps for 11 too.
�	Decreament n to 0 and exit the while loop.
