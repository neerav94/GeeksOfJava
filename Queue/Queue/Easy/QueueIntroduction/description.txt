Like Stack, Queue or First In First Out(FIFO) is a linear data type which has a collection     
     of elements which performs the following basic operations: 
     a) insert: inserts the element on the top of the queue. If the queue is full it is called an   
          overflow condition. 
      b) remove: removes the element from the queue which was inserted first of all. If the 
          queue is empty it is called underflow condition.
