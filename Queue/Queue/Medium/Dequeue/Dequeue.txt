Dequeue

Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends. The following operations are supported:
     insertFirst(): Inserts the element in the begining of the queue
     insertLast(): Inserts the element at the end of the queue
     deleteFirst(): deletes an element from the start of the queue
     deleteELast(): deletes an element from the end of the queue

HINT: Use double linked list.

Example:

•	Insert 3 at starting.
•	Insert 2 at starting.
•	Insert 4 at end.
•	Insert 1 at starting.
•	Insert 5 at end.

•	So the list will look like: 1->2->3->4->5

•	Delete 5 from last.
•	Delete 1 from start

•	So the list will look like: 2->3->4
