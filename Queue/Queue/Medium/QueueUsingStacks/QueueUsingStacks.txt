QeueUsingStacks

Implementation of queue using 2 stacks

Algorithm:
-	Create 2 stacks s1 and s2
-	insert() method:
    	if the size of s1==0:
-	push element in s2
    	else:
-	pop one by one all the elements from s1 and at the same time push them in 
-	s2. (Make sure you push them in the same order)
		push the element you want to insert in queue in s1
-	pop one by one all the elements from s2 previously inserted and at the same time push them in s1

-	delete() method:
    	if the size of s1==0:
-	underflow
    	else:
-	pop the element form s2 and return it
